# Vignettes using the CLOVER database 

The analyses in this repository are being prepared in relation to Rory Gibb*et al.* ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.14.426572v1?ct=)) "Data proliferation, reconciliation, and synthesis in viral ecology", as part of the stable release of the CLOVER database and the start of the public-facing process of VIRION development. 

### Analysis 1: Dataset differences in viral diversity
	↳ Percent variance.R

### Analysis 2: Embedding of network structure (manuscript Figure 1)
	↳ network/clover-embedding.jl

### Analysis 3: Pre- and post-reconciliation data overlap (manuscript Figure 2)
	↳ Figure 2 Code.R

### Analysis 4: Time series of host-virus association reporting (manuscript Figure 3)
	↳ network/Figure3_timeseries_code.R
